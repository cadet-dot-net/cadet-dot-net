Hey there ðŸ‘‹ \
\
I like to make things that solve my problems, and hope that they do the same for others. \
I'm mainly leaning into Elixir right now while exploring other languages.

Always working on becoming a better dev and having fun doing it. \
\
Please get in touch if you'd like to see things that I'm working on **in private** or to just find about more about me! :)\
