Hey ðŸ‘‹ if you've come to look at what I make in my spare time, you'll be sad to know most of it is private for now. \
I like to make things that solve my problems, and hope that they do the same for others. \
I'm mainly leaning into Elixir right now while exploring other languages.

Always working on becoming a better dev and having fun doing it. \
\
Please get in touch if you'd like to find out more or see something I'm working on! :)\
